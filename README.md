# Java 
These are some java codes solution which I have solved and all these codes have passed test cases. There time and space complexity is efficient too.
I prefered java for solving DSA programing since JAVA is platform independent.
JAVA(Oak )does not run directly on operating system it runs on the JVM which you have to install separately
